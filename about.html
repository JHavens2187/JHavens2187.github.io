                <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-star" style="color: var(--gold);"></i> The Scientist</h3>
                <p>I view the universe as a dataset—messy, chaotic, and governed by impersonal laws—but one that we can understand through rigorous inquiry.</p>
                <p>My work focuses on <strong>Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)</strong> and the early universe. Using data from the <strong>James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)</strong>, I analyze the spectral fingerprints of cosmic dust to reveal the hidden physics of supermassive black holes. For me, science isn't just a career; it's the fulfillment of a lifelong fight for the right to ask questions.</p>

                <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-network-wired" style="color: var(--accent-glow);"></i> The Systems Architect</h3>
                <p>I love building logic engines that create order out of chaos. Whether it's managing real-time tournament brackets or predicting NFL outcomes, I focus on the <strong>architecture</strong> of the solution.</p>
                <p>Recently, I developed a machine learning pipeline that ingests 20 years of NFL statistics, removes external biases, and utilizes ensemble modeling to identify edge cases against Vegas odds. I enjoy the high-level design of software—the flow of logic and state—just as much as the code itself.</p>

                        "My passion for science was not given to me; it was forged. I grew up in an environment where the output of millennia of human research was often dismissed because it didn't match a specific narrative. Navigating that conflict gave me a profound appreciation for the scientific process—not just as a body of facts, but as a method of finding truth."

                <p class="small text-white-50">Reading Hawking in 8th grade ignited a curiosity that couldn't be satisfied by the answers I was being given. It was the first time I realized the universe was larger, older, and more complex than I had been told.</p>

                <p class="small text-white-50">My high school years were a daily intellectual battle. When my own research into cosmology clashed with authority figures, I had to learn to verify sources, construct arguments, and stand firm in the face of pressure. This wasn't just learning; it was a fight for intellectual independence.</p>

                <p class="small text-white-50">Today, my work in outreach is driven by that history. I am dedicated to showing students that science is not a list of beliefs to accept or reject, but a tool to explore the unknown. I fight to protect the "blank page" of discovery for the next generation.</p>
