                <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-star" style="color: var(--gold);"></i> The Scientist</h3>
                <p>I view the universe as a dataset—messy, chaotic, and governed by impersonal laws—but one that we can understand through rigorous inquiry.</p>
                <p>My work focuses on <strong>Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)</strong> and the early universe. Using data from the <strong>James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)</strong>, I analyze the spectral fingerprints of cosmic dust to reveal the hidden physics of supermassive black holes. For me, science isn't just a career; it's the fulfillment of a lifelong fight for the right to ask questions.</p>

                <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-network-wired" style="color: var(--accent-glow);"></i> The Systems Architect</h3>
                <p>I love building logic engines that create order out of chaos. Whether it's managing real-time tournament brackets or predicting NFL outcomes, I focus on the <strong>architecture</strong> of the solution.</p>
                <p>Recently, I developed a machine learning pipeline that ingests 20 years of NFL statistics, removes external biases, and utilizes ensemble modeling to identify edge cases against Vegas odds. I enjoy the high-level design of software—the flow of logic and state—just as much as the code itself.</p>

                                    Growing up, I didn't just lack representation in science; I watched my school actively remove peers for their queer identities. That erasure taught me that <strong>presence is political</strong>. By being visibly queer in STEM, I aim to be the evidence I never saw: proof that you can be authentic and scientific at the same time.

                                    I am an unapologetic leftist because I believe intellectual progress requires material security. We cannot expect the next Einstein to rise from poverty if they are starving. My advocacy for <strong>Class Solidarity</strong> and <strong>Economic Justice</strong> is directly tied to my belief that science belongs to everyone, not just the elite.

                <p class="small text-white-50">Reading Hawking in 8th grade ignited a curiosity that couldn't be satisfied by the answers I was being given. It was the first time I realized the universe was larger, older, and more complex than I had been told.</p>

                <p class="small text-white-50">
                    My high school years were a daily intellectual battle. I didn't just learn science; I had to defend it. When authority figures told me that accepting the Big Bang would "send me to hell," it forced me to choose between comfortable conformity and the difficult truth. I chose the truth. This struggle forged my absolute commitment to <strong>intellectual honesty</strong>.

                <p class="small text-white-50">
                    Today, my work is driven by a desire to protect the "blank page" of discovery for others. Whether it's fighting for better science education or advocating for queer rights, my goal is to dismantle the barriers that tried to stop me, so the next generation can just focus on the stars.
